	\framesubtitle{Setup example 1}
	\begin{block}{Applied to DDT \citep{Maguire2009}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Starting point--DDT widely used, meets purpose
				\subitem $\Rightarrow$ Reliable \& valid
			\item Knowledge on toxicity arises in expert community
				\subitem $\Rightarrow$ Valid but not reliable learning
			\item Knowledge is disseminated
				\subitem $\Rightarrow$ Valid \& reliable learning
		\end{itemize}	
	\end{block}
	% Applied to BBP--some level saw the problem, other did not--took some time to work its way up

	\framesubtitle{Setup example 2}
	\begin{block}{Applied to pipeline industry}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Mid-century enthusiasm
				\subitem Engineering understanding of pipelines reliable \& valid
			\item Environmental movement + prominent spills such as Exxon Valdez
				\subitem Epistemic community of activists \citep[e.g.,][]{Estes2019}
				\subitem Epistemic community of engineers \& operators
			\item No new valid \& reliable knowledge
		\end{itemize}

	% Applied to BBP--some level saw the problem, other did not--took some time to work its way up
	\note{
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Water warriors
			\item Are pipelines safe? No. But they are safer. It's complicated.
