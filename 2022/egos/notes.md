## Theoretical framing

### Discourse literature

* Allude to the semblance of a rational discourse
	- Lay out the process of discourse and deinstitutionalization according to @Maguire2009
		+ Institution
		+ Discourse
		+ Adopted subject position
		+ Change
	- Certainly then anti-abortion activists in the US must have had the better arguments if they finally prevailed after ~200 years?
* May the better argument win, but what is the actual process by which the "better" argument wins out?
* There is some process in place by which the status quo is changed through the course of a discourse
* This is a shortcut to make the connection between discourse and deinstitutionalization
* Prior limitation
	- selection on dependent variable
	- institutional change
	- Turns out that this is a very tricky limitation to work around
* Our approach
	- Look at an institutional change
	- But also analyze what it is that convinced actors and what arguments did not work out
		
### Framing literature

* @Reinecke2021
* Neither side solely controls the course of discourse (unless there is an extreme power imbalance in play)
* Discourse turns on the interaction between specific people in a place or through a medium
* There is strategizing, but analyzing strategizing is not sufficient to understand the course of discourse, as there are contingencies in place that may only be revealed over time

### Institutional field

* @Barley2010 suggests that the field is significantly tilted toward the institutional incumbent
* Other actors give us an idea what actors there are active when talking about fossil fuel projects--we observed these and some of their "tropes"

## Context

### Climate change

* Dubious relationship between commonly used data and outcomes of interest (greenhouse gas emissions) to research business sustainability
* Business sustainability has gone mainstream, but emissions keep creeping up
* We can largely bypass social frameworks and rely more on natural frameworks when measuring emissions e.g., from space or total concentrations which gives us a good picture
* The encroaching climate change has lead to many scientists speaking out--from young scholars to established faculty, and Nobel Prize winners
	- Speaking out and engaging places the scholars in a social framework again
* We want to observe the challenges related to this process 
	- Based on the institutional field literature, we assume that many stemm from institutional insiders with vested interests, e.g., industry organizations
	- Issues that we expect actors to encounter when engaging in a public debate over issues that are clear-cut from a natural framework perspective

### Keystone XL

* We turn to a case study with ideal conditions
* A 1,897 km pipeline designed to transport oil sands from Alberta, Canada to Nebraska in the US. From there oil is transported to Texas and refined for domestic use or export
* Oil sands are more polluting by a factor between .3 (Pembina Institute) to 3 (NRDC)
	- These figures themselves are interesting--Pembina is an industry-adjacent environmental NGO and that figure is most commonly quoted
* After all: if science & social society intervention cannot prevent pollution at the source how can we hope to make progress in realms where it is more difficult to measure and control?

### Discourse on Keystone XL

* Happening at different levels in different states
* We focus on key battleground Nebraska, where progress toward a permit was halted the most
* Coincidentally, a small state with some recurring actors where discourse is relatively open and legislators reached out to scientists
	- Sense of community, little vested interest in oil and gas
	- Largely agriculture-based economy
* These are good conditions for functional discourse
	- We would expect discourse elsewhere to likely be worse and our finding to apply elsewhere as "base rate"

## Findings

### Concepts

* Dismissal
* Rules of the game
* Information dearth
* Counter coalitions

### Bigger picture

* Attempts to problematize preempted not by validity of the information, but through social framework
	- A lot of other, seemingly unrelated issues come to bear on Keystone XL
		+ E.g., Boyd County lawsuit
	- The preexisting social framework is absolutely critical
* Framing works slightly different than expected
	- Actors may switch the arena, or change the issue they are talking about
	- Compare to @Reinecke2021
* We need to attend to the social context when we want to make our opinion on an issue heard
	- The successful coalition was successful because they operated from a favorable position in the social framework--ranchers talking about eminent domain rather than environmental grassroots talking about climate change
		+ It is important to note that they tightly connected
	- Success required "bullheadedness" and was not to be counted on ("last stand")!
	- There is a quixotic component to this [@Zbaracki2021]
